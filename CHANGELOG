# New Features
Introduced (Run Order)[https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/config/settings/#run-order] attribute which allows the user to amend the way that each library is executed.
Introduced [IMDb Search Builder](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/files/builders/imdb/#imdb-search) following IMDb UI rework.
- `imdb_list` can no longer be used for Title or Keyword Searches, these must be transferred to `imdb_search` builders.
Introduced [IMDb Award Builder](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/files/builders/imdb/#imdb-award).
Added IMDb Awards to [Dynamic Collection Types](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/files/dynamic_types/#imdb-awards)
PMM Default `other_awards` has been deprecated and replace with new award PMM Default files:
  - [`berlinale`](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/defaults/award/berlinale/) - Berlin International Film Festival Awards
  - [`cesar`](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/defaults/award/cesar/) - CÃ©sar Awards
  - [`nfr`](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/defaults/award/nfr/) - National Film Registry

Reintroduced [Flixpatrol Builder](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/builders/flixpatrol/) following introduction of paywalled API.
Added a JSON Schema file which will assist users in validating their configuration file when using a code-aware text editor such as VSCode and VSCodium. This is a work in progress and will help identify basic errors such as specifying "yes" when the available options are "true" and "false"
- If you run into any validation issues which you don't understand, ask in our Discord Server

# Updates
Redesigned Wiki with new landing page and new layout using mkdocs.
Introduced batchMultiEdits - this is a major feature introduction that we hope will increase performance for all users. This is a behind-the-scenes change that the user does not need to do anything to take advantage of.
Updated `overlay_path` to `overlay_files` and split `metadata_path` into `collection_files` and `metadata_files`.
Moved `remove_overalys`, `reapply_overlays`, and `reset_overlays` to the [library level](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/config/libraries/#remove-overlays) instead of under `overlay_path`.
Removed `schedule` from under `overlay_path` and replaced it with the library level attribute [`schedule_overlays`](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/config/libraries/#schedule-overlays).
Removed library-level and collection-level logging, all logging is handled in the meta.log
Added the `score` attribute to the [`anilist_userlist`](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/files/builders/anilist/#anilist-userlist) builder.
Added the `episode_actor` attribute to the [`plex_search`](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/files/builders/plex/#plex-search) builder.

# Defaults
[PMM Default Award Files](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/defaults/files/#award-collections) have been reworked to use the `imdb_award` builder and `imdb_awards` dynamic collection type.
Reintroduced [Flixpatrol Chart Defaults Collections](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/defaults/chart/flixpatrol/).
Added Trakt Anticipated to [Trakt Chart Defaults Collections](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/defaults/chart/trakt/).
Added DE Content Rating as a PMM Default [Collection](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/defaults/both/content_rating_de/) and [Overlay](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/defaults/overlays/content_rating_de/)
Added `schedule` and `schedule_<<key>>` template variables to most defaults.

# Bug Fixes
Fixed `(404) not_found` error that presented itself in PMS 1.32.7, as outlined [here](https://discord.com/channels/822460010649878528/1099773891733377065/1174751954367422585)
Fixed issue that would prevent `file_poster` from overriding `url_poster` in the PMM Defaults.
Removed `--cache-libraries` Environment Variable due to inconsistent behaviour that could cause issues.
Fixed issue with `mass_poster_update` incorrectly updating episode posters when it shouldn't.
Fixed issue with `delete_collection_named` running in a collection even if the collection wasn't scheduled to run.
