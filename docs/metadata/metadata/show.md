# TV Show Library Metadata

You can have the script edit the metadata of Shows, Seasons, and Episodes by adding them to the `metadata` mapping of a Metadata File.

An example of multiple metadata edits in a show library is below:
```yaml
metadata:
  "Avatar: The Last Airbender":
    sort_title: Avatar 01
    seasons:
      1:
        title: "Book One: Water"
        summary: >-
              After a lapse of 100 years, the Avatar-spiritual master of the elements-has returned. And just in
              the nick of time. The Four Nations (Water, Earth, Fire, and Air) have become unbalanced. The Fire
              Nation wants to rule the world, and its first conquest will be the Northern Water Tribe. It's up to
              a 12-year-old Airbender named Aang to find a way to stop it. Join Aang, Katara, Sokka, Momo, and
              Appa as they head north on the adventure of a lifetime.

        summary: >-
              Avatar Aang continues his quest to master the four elements before the end of summer. Together with
              Katara, Sokka, Momo, and Appa, he journeys across the Earth Kingdom in search of an Earthbending
              mentor. Along the way, he confronts Princess Azula, treacherous  daughter of Firelord Ozai and
              sister to Prince Zuko. More powerful than her brother, Azula will stop nothing to defeat the Avatar.
              But Aang and the gang find plenty of Earth Kingdom allies to help them along the way. From the swamps
              of the South to the Earth King's palace, Avatar: Book 2 is an adventure like no other.
      3:
        title: "Book Three: Fire"
        summary: >-
              Having survived the terrible battle with Azula, Aang faces new challenges as he and his brave
              friends secretly enter the Fire Nation. Their quest is to find and defeat Firelord Ozai. Along
              the way, they discover that Ozai has plans of his own. The leader of the Fire Nation intends to
              use the massive power of Sozin's comet to spread his dominion permanently across the four nations.
              Short on time, Aang has a lot of bending to learn and no master to help him learn it. However, his
              friends are there to help, and he finds unexpected allies deep in the heart of the Fire Nation. In
              the spectacular four-part conclusion, Aang must fulfill his destiny and become a fully realized
              Avatar, or watch the world go up in smoke.

## Matching Shows

The `match` attribute is used to match shows within Plex to that definition within the Metadata file. One definition can match and edit multiple shows. The available matching options are outlined below.

| Attribute                      | Allowed Values                                                                                                    |
|:-------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `title`<sup>1</sup>            | Only matches shows that exactly match the show's Title. Can be a list (only one needs to match).                  |
| `year`                         | Only matches shows that were released in the given year.                                                          |
| `mapping_id`<sup>2</sup>       | Only matches shows that have the given TVDb or IMDb ID.                                                           |

1. When `title` is not provided and the mapping name was not specified as an ID, the default behaviour is to use the mapping name as `title` for matching.
2. When `mapping_id` is not provided and the mapping name was specified as an ID, the default behaviour is to use the mapping name as `mapping_id` for matching.

### Examples

Below are some examples on how shows can be matched.

#### Example 1 - `title` and `mapping_id` 

The below example shows how `title` and `mapping_id` can be used to match shows.

```yaml
metadata:
  show1:                   # Matches via the title "Game of Thrones"
    match:
      title: Game of Thrones
    edits...
  show2:                   # Matches via TVDb ID: 366524
    match:
      mapping_id: 366524
    edits...
  show3:                   # Matches via IMDb ID: tt10234724
    match:
      mapping_id: tt10234724
    edits...
  show4:                   # Matches via the title "24" 
    match:
      title: 24
    edits...
```

The Mapping Name can also be used to reduce line-count, as shown here:

```yaml
metadata:
  Game of Thrones:  # Matches via the Name "Game of Thrones"
    edits...
  366524:           # Matches via TVDb ID: 366524
    edits...
  tt10234724:       # Matches via IMDb ID: tt10234724
    edits...
  "24":             # Matches via the Name "24" 
    edits...
```

**Note:** to search for a show titled with a number from the mapping name you must surround the number in quotes like in the example below. Otherwise, it will look for the show associated with that TVDb ID.

#### Example 2 - `title` and `year`

The below example shows how `title` and `year` can be used to match shows. 

In this example, there are two shows in the library called "Vikings", so the `year` attribute is used to identify which show is being matched.

```yaml
metadata:
  Vikings (2012):                   # Matches via the title "Vikings" released in 2012
    match:
      title: Vikings
      year: 2012
    edits...
  Vikings (2013):                   # Matches via the title "Vikings" released in 2013
    match:
      title: Vikings
      year: 2013
    edits...
```
